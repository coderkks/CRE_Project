Problem Statement : 
In the presence of a specific enzyme E, which acts as a homogeneous catalyst, 
a harmful organic A present in industrial waste water degrades into harmless 
chemicals. At a given enzyme concentration Ce, tests in a laboratory mixed flow 
reactor give the following results: 
Ca0 (mmol/m3) 2   5 6  6 11 14 16 24 
Ca (mmol/m3)  0.5 3 1  2  6 10  8  4 
Tau(min)      30  1 50 8  4 20 20  4

We wish to treat 0.1 m3/min of this waste water having Ca0 = 10 mmol/m3 to 
90% conversion with this enzyme at concentration Ce.
